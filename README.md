# Mern-Blog
 Building a blog from scratch.


 1. I want to blog a bit.   Don't want any censor nonsense from establised Blog site providers.
 2. I'm a coder?  Yes!!
 3. Solution? Code my own damn blog yo! 
 4. ???
 5. Profit!!


 Stuff I will use:

 React
 MongoDB
 Express
 Nodejs
 Firebase

 
 
 Really though, WHY the hell would any sane coder spent 30 plus hours coding up a blog project when
 the average civilian is just gonna download and install Wordpress and be up and running in 5 minutes or less?

 yeah .. good question.
